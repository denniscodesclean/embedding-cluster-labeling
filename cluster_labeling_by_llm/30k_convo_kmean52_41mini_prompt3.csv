But a competing public option and buy-in proposals would leave more than a 100 million Americans at the mercy of for-profit insurers. By building on the promises of the Affordable Care Act and incorporating the lessons learned from decades of public programs like Medicare and Medicaid, Medicare for All would ensure that everyone has access to the care they need, including primary care, reproductive health, mental health services, dental, vision and long-term care. Only Medicare for All can make that guarantee. Americans struggle to afford long-term care, especially for home-based services. Seniors who need long-term care are forced to prove they are already in poverty or must spend down their assets until they are in poverty to qualify for Medicaid, and many of states force Americans into nursing homes, limiting their choices and autonomy. Medicare for All would allow seniors and people with disabilities to get the care they need in the setting of their choice, without out-of-pocket costs. Coverage for long-term care varies under different public option proposals, but none would guarantee access without out-of-pocket costs.\n======END OF CHUNK======', 'Create a dictionary of random keys and values.

Safra, a French company that specializes in the renovation of passenger transport equipment and a pioneer in hydrogen mobility, presented a hydrogen coach at the recent UITP Summit that took place in Barcelona last week. The hydrogen retrofitted coach features the company’s H2-PACK kit, which has been designed to convert a combustion-powered intercity coach into a zero-emission vehicle. The H2-PACK retrofit kit is fully designed and assembled by Safra. The retrofit kit allows the vehicle’s diesel engine to be transformed into a zero-emission hydrogen-electric powertrain. The original diesel engine is replaced by a 350 kW Dana electric motor that receives power from a 100 kW (70 kW useful) Plastic Omnium fuel cell. According to Safra, the H2 used by the hydrogen coach is stored in six tanks, which have been integrated into an area of the vehicle that is separated from the passengers by a watertight, ventilated and secure partition. The tanks allow for 35 kg of hydrogen to be carried on board, delivering a maximum range of 500 km. The hydrogen coach presented at the event belongs to the Occitanie Region. This is France’s second-largest region by surface area, and it has commissioned Safra with retrofitting 15 of its intercity coaches.”\n', 'Create a list of 3 startup ideas in enterprise B2B SaaS.

Then, provide advice on which vitamins and minerals should be supplemented if NAC is taken over a longer period of time. Include all supplements that will be necessary or that you would recommend and give the reason for them.\n\n### Input:\nAcetylcysteine is indicated for mucolytic therapy and in the management of acetaminophen overdose. It has a short duration of action as it is given every 1-8 hours depending on route of administration, and has a wide therapeutic window. Patients should be counselled regarding diluting oral solutions in cola for taste masking, the risk of hypersensitivity, and the risk of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage.\n\nAcetylcysteine serves as a prodrug to L-cysteine, a precursor to the biologic antioxidant glutathione. Hence administration of acetylcysteine replenishes glutathione stores.Glutathione, along with oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), have been found to bind to the glutamate recognition site of the NMDA and AMPA receptors (via their γ-glutamyl moieties), and may be endogenous neuromodulators. At millimolar concentrations, they may also modulate the redox state of the NMDA receptor complex. In addition, glutathione has been found to bind to and activate ionotropic receptors that are different from any other excitatory amino acid receptor, and which may constitute glutathione receptors, potentially making it a neurotransmitter. As such, since N-acetylcysteine is a prodrug of glutathione, it may modulate all of the aforementioned receptors as well. Glutathione also modulates the NMDA receptor by acting at the redox site.\n\nL-cysteine also serves as a precursor to cystine, which in turn serves as a substrate for the cystine-glutamate antiporter on astrocytes; hence there is increasing glutamate release into the extracellular space. This glutamate in turn acts on mGluR2/3 receptors, and at higher doses of acetylcysteine, mGluR5.\n\nAcetylcysteine also possesses some anti-inflammatory effects possibly via inhibiting NF-κB and modulating cytokine synthesis. Acetylcysteine is extensively liver metabolized, CYP450 minimal, urine excretion is 22–30% with a half-life of 5.6 hours in adults and 11 hours in newborns.\n\nA number of possible mechanisms for the mucolytic activity of acetylcysteine have been proposed. Acetylcysteine's sulfhydryl groups may hydrolize disulfide bonds within mucin, breaking down the oligomers, and making the mucin less viscous. Acetylcysteine has also been shown to reduce mucin secr"", 'list most common DOACs. compare to drug class of atorvastatin.', 'Patient Name: John Smith\nDate of Birth: 01/01/1960\nDate of Visit: 05/07/2023\n\nChief Complaint: Follow-up visit for type 2 diabetes management\n\nHistory of Present Illness: John Smith is a 63-year-old male with a history of type 2 diabetes.

Aj tieto návrhy sú bolestivé, ale viedli by k odstráneniu štrukturálneho deficitu štátneho rozpočtu.”\n\nZeman sa pripojil k zoznamu kritikov od odborov až po lídra opozície Andreja Babiša, ktorý začiatkom tohto týždňa prisľúbil, že v prípade svojho návratu do funkcie zruší všetky navrhované zvýšenia daní.\n\nNapriek tomu, že Fiala neustále sľubuje, že nebude zavádzať úsporné opatrenia s cieľom znížiť štátny dlh Česka, pristúpil ku kontroverznému zvyšovaniu daní vrátane zvýšenia minimálnych odvodov pre samostatne zárobkovo činné osoby, zvýšenia dane z príjmov právnických osôb z 19 na 21 % a daňového útoku na tých, ktorí zarábajú viac ako trojnásobok českej priemernej mzdy.\n\nVláda plánuje zrušiť 22 existujúcich daňových výnimiek vrátane súčasnej zľavy na dani pre študentov, zvýšiť poistné pre samostatne zárobkovo činné osoby a zvýšiť dane z alkoholu a tabaku.\n\nTento krok vyvolal tento týždeň pobúrenie medzi odborovými predákmi, pričom predseda odborového zväzu ČMKOS Josef Středula požadoval diskusiu o týchto plánoch a odmietol vylúčiť štrajkovú akciu.\n\nV utorok odborový zväz ČMKOS zverejnil výsledky prieskumu, podľa ktorého bude mať priemerná česká rodina po zavedení vládnych opatrení o 17 až 20 percent nižší disponibilný príjem ročne.\n\n“Za rozhodnutím o štrajkovej pohotovosti si stojíme.
