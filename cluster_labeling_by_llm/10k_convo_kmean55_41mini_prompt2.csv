Instead, he shows us some carefully selected data. In 75 surprising graphs, we see that safety, peace, knowledge and health are getting better all over the world.

One cannot help wondering how many people actually living in poverty would agree.\n\nThe real problem, Pinker argues, is that the Enlightenment values of reason and science are under attack.
